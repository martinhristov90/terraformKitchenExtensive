## This repository is created with learning purposes for Terraform, focusing how to use KitchenCI extensive testing alongside Terraform.

## Purpose :

- It provides a simple example of how to use KitchenCI extensive testing to verify the provisioned with Terraform infrastructure.

## How to install terraform : 

- The information about installing terraform can be found on the HashiCorp website 
[here](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)



## Clone this project
- In a directory of your choice, clone the github repository :
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/martinhristov90/terraformKitchenExtensive.git
    ```
- Change into the directory :
    ```
    cd terraformKitchenExtensive
    ```

## How to setup KitchenCI and RBENV (MacOS Mojave 10.14.5) :

- Run `brew install ruby`
- After previous command finish, run `gem install rbenv`, this would give you ability to choose particular version of Ruby. This is a prerequisite.
- Run the following two commands, to setup Ruby environment for the local directory.
    ```bash
    echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
    echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bash_profile
    ```
- Reload your BASH interpreter or apply the changes to the profile :
    ```shell
    source ~/.bash_profile 
    ```
- Verify rbenv is installed properly with :
    ```shell
    type rbenv   # → "rbenv is a function"
    ```
- To install the particular version that we need, run the following command in the project directory:
    ```shell
    rbenv install 2.5.3
    ```
- Set local version to be used with command :
    ```shell
    rbenv local 2.5.3
    ```
- Previous step is going to create a file named .ruby-version, with the following content `2.5.3`

- Next, [Bundler](https://bundler.io) needs to be installed, run `gem install bundler`, this would provide the dependencies that KitchenCI needs. It is going to install the Gems defined in the `Gemfile`

## Setup KitchenCI:
- Install the needed Gems for KitchenCI using Bundle with command :
    ```shell
    bundle install
    ```
- Now you should have KitchenCI installed and running, verify with `bundle exec kitchen list`, the output should look like :
    ```
    Instance                Driver     Provisioner  Verifier   Transport  Last Action    Last Error
    extensive-suite-centos  Terraform  Terraform    Terraform  Ssh        <Not Created>  <None>
    extensive-suite-ubuntu  Terraform  Terraform    Terraform  Ssh        <Not Created>  <None>
    ```

## How to use it :

- Make sure that you are in the project's directory.

- Edit a filed named `env.tfvars` in `test/fixtures/wrapper` with the following content that fits for you:
    ```
    access_key = "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"
    secret_key = "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
    region = "YOUR_REGION"
    ```
- Create SSH key pair executing following commands in the project's root directory :
    ```
    cd test/assets/
    ssh-keygen -b 1024 -C "Kitchen-Terraform AWS provider tutorial" -f key_pair -N "" -t rsa
    ```

- Now, `bundle exec kitchen converge` should be used to provision the infrastructure that is going to be tested, the output should look like :
    ```

       Outputs:

       remote_group_public_dns = [

           ec2-52-206-1-188.compute-1.amazonaws.com
       ]
       static_terraform_output = static terraform output
       terraform_state = /Users/martinhristov/Tasks/TerraformLearn/terraformKitchenExtensive/test/fixtures/wrapper/terraform.tfstate.d/kitchen-terraform-extensive-suite-centos/terraform.tfstate
       Finished converging <extensive-suite-centos> (1m7.24s).

       Outputs:

       remote_group_public_dns = [

       ]
       static_terraform_output = static terraform output
    --- SNIP ---
    ```
- Now, the testing of the AWS instances is going to be performed to verify if they pass Inspec tests. Run `bundle exec kitchen verify` The output should look like :
